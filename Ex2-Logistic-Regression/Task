In this exercise, I implemented logistic regression for two cases to fit a classification model with minimum cost using 
advanced optimization algorithms (fminunc).
Additionally, the data and logistic regression fit are plotted for visualization purposes. 
In the first part, we want to estimate the probability of an applicant's admission using two exam scores.
In the second part, we want to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance using regularized 
logistic regression on a dataset of two different test results.
