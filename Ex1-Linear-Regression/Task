In this exercise, I implemented linear regression for two cases to fit a model with minimum cost. 
The learning algorithms used were Gradient Descent and normal equation. 
Additionally, the data and linear regression fit are plotted for visualization purposes. 
In the first part, we want to predict profits for a food truck using a single variable (population of different cities).
In the second part, we want to predict prices of houses using multiple variables (size of the house and number of bedrooms).
